Hybrid Weather and News App

Weather and news application developed using Ionic framework V3 with the use of 
OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather information and NewsAPI to fetch news stories.

This app uses OpenWeatherMap API to report the weather of different cities and the 
NewsAPI reports the top 5 stories of the selected city. Ionic storage is also 
implemented to store the location and unit input gotten from users.
API requests are made through HTTP. The app also shows the current date on the Home Page.
In the Settings page, when a city is entered and a unit is selected and 
page saved, the app displays the temperature of the selected city and the 
Top 5 News Stories of that city in the Home page.
The default location and unit for this application is Galway and Metric.
